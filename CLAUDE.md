# Poll Automation System - AI-Powered Survey Registration

## System Overview
This is a professional AI-powered automation system for intelligently registering on survey sites and completing surveys. The system uses advanced AI, computer vision, and machine learning to adapt to any form layout and complete registrations like a human would.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Form Analysis
- **AI-Powered Form Understanding**: Uses LLM/GPT to analyze any registration form
- **Computer Vision**: Takes screenshots and analyzes forms visually
- **Adaptive Field Recognition**: Understands what each field is for regardless of naming conventions
- **Dynamic Form Handling**: Adapts to changing form layouts, new fields, and different designs

### 2. Human-like Interaction
- **Realistic Data Generation**: Creates believable user profiles with consistent data
- **Human Timing Patterns**: Varies typing speed, pause times, and interaction patterns
- **Advanced Evasion**: TLS fingerprinting, proxy rotation, browser fingerprint spoofing
- **Behavioral Mimicry**: Mimics real human registration behavior patterns

### 3. Error Handling & Validation
- **Validation Error Detection**: Reads screen after form submission to detect validation errors
- **Intelligent Error Fixing**: Analyzes error messages and fills missing required fields
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries with corrected data when validation fails
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Learns from errors and adjusts approach

### 4. Email Management
- **Multiple Email Services**: TempMail, 10MinuteMail, Guerrilla Mail, ProtonMail
- **Email Reuse System**: Saves all created emails to database for reuse
- **Verification Handling**: Automatically checks for and clicks verification emails
- **Rate Limit Management**: Reuses existing emails when daily limits are reached

### 5. Database Integration

- **Email Correlation**: Links emails to registrations, questions, and survey sites
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitors performance and success rates per site
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Builds knowledge base of site patterns and defenses

## Key Principles

### LLM-Powered Form Intelligence
- ✅ **Core Approach**: Use LLM to read HTML source and identify form elements
- ✅ **Honeypot Detection**: Ask LLM to identify hidden/trap fields and avoid them
- ✅ **Universal Compatibility**: Work with any website form structure
- ✅ **Intelligent Field Recognition**: Understand field purpose from context, not hardcoded patterns
- ✅ **Dynamic Adaptation**: Handle changing forms, new fields, and different layouts

### Be Intelligent, Not Hardcoded
- ❌ **Don't**: Hardcode field names, selectors, or form patterns
- ✅ **Do**: Use AI to understand what fields are asking for
- ❌ **Don't**: Rely on static keyword matching
- ✅ **Do**: Analyze context, labels, and visual cues
- ✅ **NEW**: Let LLM analyze raw HTML and provide reliable CSS selectors

### Always Read and React
- ❌ **Don't**: Submit forms blindly without checking results
- ✅ **Do**: Read screen after submission to detect validation errors
- ❌ **Don't**: Ignore red error messages or validation failures
- ✅ **Do**: Parse error messages and fix missing fields automatically
- ✅ **NEW**: Use LLM to understand validation error messages and determine fixes

### Adapt to Change
- ❌ **Don't**: Fail when forms change structure or add new fields
- ✅ **Do**: Use AI to understand new form layouts dynamically
- ❌ **Don't**: Give up on sites that use different naming conventions
- ✅ **Do**: Analyze form purpose regardless of technical implementation
- ✅ **NEW**: Universal form automation that works on any site

### Resource Conservation
- ❌ **Don't**: Create new emails when hitting rate limits
- ✅ **Do**: Reuse existing emails from database for new registrations
- ❌ **Don't**: Waste resources on redundant operations
- ✅ **Do**: Check database for existing data before creating new
